Description:
The Smart Irrigation System is a comprehensive solution for efficient and precise irrigation management in agricultural settings. By leveraging IoT technologies, this project enables farmers to monitor and control irrigation remotely, ensuring optimal water usage and crop health.

The system utilizes a network of sensors to collect environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture levels. These data points are then analyzed in real-time to determine irrigation requirements. Integration with the OpenWeatherMap API provides additional insights into weather patterns, allowing for proactive irrigation scheduling based on forecasted conditions.

The repository contains the codebase for the embedded systems, including firmware for the ESP8266 NodeMCU and Arduino UNO, as well as documentation for setup and usage. With its modular design and extensible architecture, the Smart Irrigation System offers scalability and adaptability to various agricultural environments.

Deploying this IoT solution empowers farmers with actionable insights, leading to improved crop yield, resource conservation, and sustainable farming practices.
